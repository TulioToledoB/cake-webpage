# Cakes Co Mission üßÅ

The aim of this exercise is to create a **responsive webpage** showcasing your cake business.

Two wireframes are provided down below (scroll to the bottom).

## üë©‚Äçüîß To work on the website from inside your CodeSpace or Visual Studio: 

Press Ctrl + Shift + P (Cmd + Shift + P on mac) and type: `CodeSwing: Open Swing...`

Press Enter, when you see `/workspaces/htmlcss-zoo/`, press Enter again. You should see the website preview on the right!

## Task

### Start with mobile
- Write the HTML following the mobile design
- Then write your CSS for everything to look great on mobile
- Remember to link your CSS file to your HTML file inside the `<head>` in `index.html`
- You don't need to use any media queries yet, because we're following a [Mobile First](https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/mobile-first-design/) approach!

### Then adapt the page for larger screens
- Now add media queries to your CSS, and change the layout and sizing of elements so they make better use of a wider screen (see the desktop wireframe design below).
- To follow Mobile First principles, we will only be using `min-width` in our media queries (no max-width!)
- You should **use 2 different breakpoints**, meaning you should have **3** different variants of your layout. Here's an example.  
  

  If we have the following **2 breakpoints**:  
  > - breakpoint 1 --> 540px  
  > - breakpoint 2 --> 900px  

  Then our CSS code will be split into **3**:  
  > 1. **"default"**: default styles, should implement the mobile design (no media query used for these). These styles will apply to all screen sizes by default.  
  > 2. **"medium"**: Our first media query `@media (min-width: 540px) {...}` **will overwrite our default styles** for screens at least 540px wide. Screens *below* 540px will apply the styles from the "default".  
  > 3. **"large"**: Our second media query `@media (min-width: 900px) {...}` **will overwrite our default AND medium styles** for screens at least 900px wide (no upper limit).  

### Define your own style
  - Choose 1-2 fonts to use (lots of [free fonts here](https://fonts.google.com/))
  - Choose 2-3 colours that you think go together well, and try to limit yourself to those in your CSS ([look here](https://coolors.co/palettes/trending) for inspiration)
  - Select some nice cake pictures to replace the placeholders in the wireframes (good [photo source here](https://unsplash.com/images/food/cake)).
  - Get creative! Can you add some cool hover effects to buttons and [images](https://www.wix.com/website-template/view/html/1911?siteId=c1c72d26-c040-41f2-80ce-0b0f8aef01b4&metaSiteId=5d77fab8-f068-4228-8b61-4181af054ca6&originUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wix.com%2Fwebsite%2Ftemplates&tpClick=view_button)?

### Also
- It's up to you to find a solution for any elements that are visible in desktop and not on mobile - and vice versa.


## Remember
 - **Commit and push your code often** so you get into the habit and you avoid losing any code that you write if your machine crashes for example. 
 - Once you're ready to submit your homework for review, do a final push.


## Deployment (optional)

[Deploy your work to Netlify!](https://syllabus.codeyourfuture.io/workshops/deployment/workshop/instructions/)
Remember to follow this naming convention when creating your custom URL in Netlify: `https://mc-[your-Github-username]-cakes.netlify.app/`


## Wireframes

Build the mobile wireframe first, then adapt it for larger screens.
